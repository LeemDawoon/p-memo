1.Introduction

* Our main contributions are threefold. 
  * • We propose a pyramid scene parsing network to embed difficult scenery context features in an FCN based pixel prediction framework. 
  * • We develop an effective optimization strategy for deep ResNet \[13\] based on deeply supervised loss. 
  * • We build a practical system for state-of-the-art scene parsing and semantic segmentation where all crucial implementation details are included.
