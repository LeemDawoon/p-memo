The motivation is that _the class label assigned to one pixel is the category of the object that the pixel belongs to._

### 3.2. Formulation

* \(1\) structurizes all the pixels in image I into K **soft object regions**.
  * We partition the image I into K soft object regions $$ \{M_{1}, ... ,M_{K}\}$$. 
  * Each object region $$ M_{k}$$  corresponds to the class k

* \(2\) represents each object region as fk by aggregating the representations of all the pixels in the kth object region.
  * **Object region representations.**

* \(3\) augments the representation for each pixel by aggregating the K object region representations with consideration of its relations with all the object regions:
  * **Object contextual representations.**
