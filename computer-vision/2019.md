I. INTRODUCTION

SegNet \[2\], ENet \[15\], and ICNet \[25\],

convolutional LSTMs \(convLSTMs \[19\]\)



II. RELATED WORK

VOS에서 RNN의 두가지 적용분야.

* 1\)  On one side, they are used to capture temporal information of a video sequence.
* 2\) On the other side, RNNs are used to learn the global context of one image.
  * 각 이미지의 segment 정보가 다른 LSTM에 물려서 들어가는데, 이미지 region 간의 spatial relationship을 학습할 수 있다.

Recurrent Fully Convolutional Network \(RFCN, \[22\]\), which was introduced by Valipour et al. in 2017. They extended the FCN approach \[18\] by placing a recurrent unit between the encoder and the decoder, and exhibit better performance on the SegTrack, Davis, and Moving MNIST dataset.
