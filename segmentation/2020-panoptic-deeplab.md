3.1. Architecture 

* Panoptic-DeepLab consists of four components: 
  * \(1\) an encoder backbone shared for both semantic segmentation and instance segmentation, 
  * \(2\) decoupled ASPP modules 
  * \(3\) decoupled decoder modules specific to each task
  * \(4\) task-specific prediction heads.
* Basic architecture:
* Semantic segmentation head:
* Class-agnostic instance segmentation head:
